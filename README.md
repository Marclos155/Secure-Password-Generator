## **How It Works**

This password generator works by utilizing a Python function that combines random elements to create a password. The core functionality is powered by the Python `random` module, which ensures the password is generated with a high level of unpredictability.

### **Key Function:**

The script uses the function `generate_password(length)` from the file **`password_generator.py`**. Hereâ€™s a quick breakdown of how it works:

- **Input**: The function takes a desired password length as an argument.
- **Process**: It randomly selects characters from a pool of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.
- **Output**: It returns a password of the specified length, combining the different types of characters to ensure maximum security.
